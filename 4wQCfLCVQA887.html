                    <p> <strong>Why now is a great opportunity to sell all the shares?</strong><p><span></span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>The market has already grown by more than 30% relative to the March lows. In various telegram channels and groups, I already see information saying that the worst is over! The peak of the crisis has passed, the markets they are recovering, and the economy will soon begin to recover... In General, we smile and wave. We are happy to bring money to the market and buy still relatively cheap assets (no).<br></span></p><p><span>I remain bearish. Today, the market is getting close to the level of 3000 points on the SP500 index, which is a great joy for me , since on this rebound, it was possible to get rid of the last small share of shares in the portfolios of my clients. </span><span><b>Why?</b></span></p><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span></span></p><p><span>Just take a look at the attached schedule. It shows the levels of corporate income (after taxes) and S&amp;P 500. Note that these charts have only moved far apart once in the last 50 years: before the dot-com bubble burst. This is why it was called a bubble, because people's expectations from the market were very different from real economic indicators! As a result, the bears took over the market for 2 years-up to until the level of corporate earnings and the market again moved closer. On my channel, I talked about </span><span></span><a>various market bubbles in which investors lost the most money, including bitcoin </a><span>. All bubbles in the market tend to explode, and the last bubble that is currently on the market, it can cause great pain to all market participants.<br><br></span><span><i>This is what Adam Smith called the invisible hand of the market, which leads everything to fair values.</i><br><br></span><span>Accordingly, what should happen for the two charts to converge again?<br></span></p><p><span><b>Option one: </b></span><span>they should grow up a lot. revenue! But... how do you even imagine it now? When is the quarantine declared and the economy suspended? I am afraid that in this direction we will fail on all fronts, we can see a decline in corporate income by 20-30% straight easily, if not more. <br></span></p><p><span><b>The second option: </b></span><span>the market will start to fall. I bet on that your entire speculative portfolio, plus a double shoulder (I highly do not recommend doing this). During my career, I made many mistakes, and I told you about </span><span></span><a>the 5 most important ones in the video </a><span>.<br></span></p><p><span><i>Unfortunately, there is no third option.</i></span><span><br></span></p><p><span>The market may remain at the current levels for some time or even grow by a factor of one unlimited liquidity, but this is an artificial growth, in the current reality, shares should be </span><span><i>much cheaper </i></span><span>. <br>Also, such a raskorrelation indicates that we are not waiting for a V-shaped crisis, when everything quickly collapsed and quickly grew (as in 2008), but we are waiting for an L-shaped crisis, when everything quickly collapses, but to grow back it will be quite a long time.<br></span></p><p><span>Today I have told you about only one of the indicators that reflect the current situation. I keep track of dozens of them. And so I am confident in my understanding of what is happening. Yesterday I scraped all their money on the subject of free exchange cache and send them to your investment account (not speculative, of course). I also want to tell you about </span><span></span><a>the 12 rules for successful investing</a><span>, for which I paid too much. <br><br> If you are interested in the topic of investing in the stock market and earning money on the Internet, then welcome to </span><span></span><a>my Youtube channel </a><span>and </span><span></span><a>my group Vkontakte </a><span>.
