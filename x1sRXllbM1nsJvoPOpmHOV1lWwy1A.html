Magic of defensive assets.</strong><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><p><span>Another nervous week turned out on the stock markets. Again Friday and a total sale on the Moscow stock exchange. Beginners "stiff" and many start to sell stocks, succumbing to emotions and panic. </span></p><div><div></div></div><p><span><b>This week, from March 2 to 6, the Moscow stock exchange index fell by 2.35%.</b></span><span>  The decline from the highs has already amounted to 15.5%. But despite this, there are strong nuts that went against the market and grew.  I suggest that we consider them and make a small review of each. Let's start as usual with the 5th place gradually moving to the leader!</span></p><h3><span>5th place - Surgutneftegaz-AP</span></h3><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Weekly chart of preferred shares of Surgutneftegaz</span></figcaption></figure><p><span><b>Prefs of Surgut showed an increase of 3.9%. </b></span><span>in terms of technology, it is difficult to immediately note something obvious other than the rebound from 32.5 rubles and the movement in range 35-37. 5 rubles. The growth was caused by a sharp increase in the dollar-to-ruble exchange rate from 66.5 to 68.5 rubles at the moment, even from 65.5 rubles per dollar.</span></p><p><span>Since the company has a huge dollar pot, it is constantly overestimated in rubles and with the growth of the dollar exchange rate, a paper profit is obtained and the higher the dollar, the higher it is more.</span></p><p><span> The company can be kept in your portfolio as a protection against a weak ruble. But if there is a situation like in 2019, when the ruble strengthened against the dollar by 11%, the company has the opposite situation (paper loss) and the quotes will respond with a decrease.</span></p><p><span>Personally, I don't have a company in my portfolio yet, but after dividends for 2019 and a reduction in the area of 27.5-30 rubles, I will take a little in the portfolio. Since this is a security asset with closed management, the share will be 2 times less than the usual one.</span></p><p><span><b>The estimated dividend for 2019 will be 1.5 rubles </b></span><span>, which will yield 3.83% of the net dividend yield at current prices </span><span><b>.</b></span><span> Quite humbly.</span></p><h3><span>4th place-inter RAO</span></h3><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Weekly schedule of inter RAO shares</span></figcaption></figure><p><span><b>Inter RAO's shares rose by 4.8%.</b></span><span> Technically, the increase is caused simply by a rebound after a weekly drop of about 14%. For a harmonious growth, I would like to see a trip down with a retest of 5 rubles and going up. Energy is considered a protective asset in the investor's portfolio, but not in our market(.</span></p><blockquote><span>This week the company reported for the year and showed decent indicators:<br></span><span><b>Revenue: </b></span><span>+7.2% to 1.03 trillion rubles<br></span><span><b>Operating profit: </b></span><span>+12.6% to 98.3 billion rubles'<br></span><span><b>Net profit: </b></span><span>+14.3% to 81.93 billion rubles.</span></blockquote><p><span>Inter RAO continues to accumulate money on its balance sheet, the volume of which has already reached 260 billion rubles, but no one is clear for what purposes this is being done. The company is silent. 25% of the state of emergency is still allocated for dividends, which curbs the growth of quotations and keeps the economy stable. underestimating your business.</span></p><p><span>If the management will fork out and start paying 50% of the state of emergency, then we can see a picture of explosive growth as for Gazprom shares in may 2019. When paying 25% of the state of emergency</span><span><b>, the forecast dividend is equal to 0.196 rubles </b></span><span>or 3.12% of the net div.yields. This is very small!</span></p><p><span>The company is not in my portfolio and she doesn't even look there yet. There are more attractive energy sources on our market.</span></p><h3><span>3rd place-pole Gold</span></h3><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Weekly chart of Polyus Gold shares</span></figcaption></figure><p><span><b>Polyus shares rose 5%.</b></span><span> Similarly, after a week of correction, further growth followed. The level of 8000 rubles in the days looked like a potential resistance and it would be good to confirm it, but here when fears of global investors are growing and they run into protective assets, it would be stupid to expect a decline in the shares of one of </span><span><b>the most profitable companies in the world </b></span><span>for gold mining.</span></p><p><span>The report was published in mid-February and everything is expected to be fine there. With continued fears and the spread of coronavirus will result in an increase in gold prices and the strengthening of the dollar against the ruble. And for Polus, this means additional profit. According to the Foundation, everything is fine here.</span></p><p><span><b>The growth may reach up to 10 000</b></span><span>. Forecasts here to build it is very difficult, but the first goal of 9000 test which has already been and the quotes go there. Buy now I would probably not have become as to sell the paper. Here I would take the position there is a stock </span><span><b>"Hold"</b></span><span>. There are no Polus shares in my portfolio.</span></p><h3><span>2nd place - MMC Norilsk Nickel</span></h3><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Weekly schedule of MMC Norilsk Nickel shares</span></figcaption></figure><p><span><b>MMC shares gained 7.5% </b></span><span>. After a good decline and an important test <br>20,000 rubles of the campaign will be used to further climb the mountain peaks. The price of palladium continues to rise, and therefore the stock goes the same way.</span></p><p><span>The company at the end of February provided its annual report on IFRS for 2019. MMC continues to break records for net profit and dividends. Despite the cosmic growth, shares at current prices yield </span><span><b>a 9.9% dividend yield.</b></span></p><p><span>Recommendations are approximately like the Pole there are shares hold boldly and get your 2-digit dividends, which also grow in quantitative terms as and the shares themselves. </span><span><b>I don't have </b></span><span>any shares , so I'll be jealous in silence!</span></p><h2><span>1st place - Polymetal</span></h2><figure><div><div></div><div><img></div><div></div></div><meta><figcaption><span>Weekly schedule of Polymetal shares</span></figcaption></figure><p><span><b>Polymetal rose 12.1% </b></span><span>to become the leader this week. The required retest of 1,000 rubles took place twice, so that additionally emphasizes the strength and importance of this mark. According to the technique, quotes will move to the zone of 1200 rubles.</span></p><blockquote><span>This week, the company reported for 2019.<br></span><span><b>Revenue:</b></span><span> +19% to 2.2 billion $<br></span><span><b>Net profit:</b></span><span> +36% to 483 million $<br></span><span><b>Scor.net profit: </b></span><span>+31% to 586 million $</span></blockquote><p><span>Polymetal continues to adhere to its dividend policy of </span><span><b>paying 50% of the total score.net profit under debt load net debt / EBITDA no higher than 2.5 x.</b></span><span>  And for the 2nd half of </span><span><b>the year, it directs $ 0.42 </b></span><span>to dividends, which is about 2.2% at the current rate. Not much, but for a protective asset in the portfolio fine.</span></p><p><span>As you can see on the chart this Friday, </span><span><b>I took a little stock in the portfolio at the price of 1,155 rubles for 0.5% of my portfolio </b></span><span>. I will not sell, but only buy more if there is a possible decline, when the market situation calms down.  In the meantime, let me have at least a little of the dollar-denominated security asset in my portfolio yield. Payment of dividends 2 times a year, and in a favorable situation, the company also pays special dividends.</span></p><p><span>I do not advise you to buy at current prices, but if the share is very large, then you can reduce it a little bit!</span></p><blockquote><span>Despite the decline in the index, there are companies in our market that are growing.<br></span><span><u><i> By the way, I did a little shopping this Friday!</i></u></span><span><br></span><span><b>What did you do this week and which stocks showed the most growth / decline?</b></span></blockquote><h3><span>For subscribing and putting a like, a huge thank you from me!<br></span></h3><div></div></p>
