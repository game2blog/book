Yesterday, the Bank of Canada cut the rate by 0.5%, which was slightly stronger than market expectations. But after such a sharp decline, the last doubt that everything was going down disappeared the actions of the Central Bank are coordinated among themselves, which means that the fed will reduce the rate by another 0.25% on March 18. Only our Central Bank of the Russian Federation, as well as the whole of Russia, goes its own way, known only to </i></span><span></span><span><i>it…</i></span></p><p><span><b>Debt market</b></span><span>-In the morning, the yield on us bonds is </span><span><b>10Y </b></span><span>( </span><span><i>ten-year paper</i></span><span>) it is at </span><span><b>1.01% </b></span><span>, and </span><span><b>3M </b></span><span>( </span><span><i>three-month bonds </i></span><span>) is at 0 </span><span><b>.68%.

There is no intrigue and the fed also has no options, other than to continue monetary policy easing.</b></span></p><p><span><b>S&amp;P500 index</b></span><span>-Gradually, the stock market begins to recover after the February sales. Monetary and fiscal incentives will gradually have a positive effect on the market and the economy, but the main task to extinguish the panic in the market seems to have been completed. Yes, the world economy is sick, various financial bubbles are inflated, a huge amount of debt in the world, and that among them there are many with negative returns. This fact is generally difficult to logically understand, but since this is on the market, then you have to reckon with it, although the absurdity of this is obvious. Nevertheless, let's be realistic. And so, if we put aside all the facts and don't worry too much about them, we must admit the fact that we have seen the lowest levels in stock indices, which means that </span><span><b>we will see growth in these indices</b></span><span>, at least in the near future. Today, we expect a range </span><span><b>of 3030-3175. </b></span></p><p><span><b>RTS and MICEX</b></span><span>-In our stock market, while prices are consolidating, before a new growth cycle. As I wrote, in one of the articles last Friday, the market formed a price bottom, after record trading volumes, triggering a large number of margin calls, a strong price failure and of course the panic of retail investors. It has always been this way, it is this way, and it will always be this way. </span><span><b>Corrections like the one that took place in February are bound to happen once or twice a year, always </b></span><span>. Here I have never been able to understand people who invested in the stock market in the "heat of attack" or because of fear of not having time. After all, when in ordinary life, you are going to purchase something expensive, long-term, such as a car, apartment or cottage, you do not run headlong and do not buy at the first prices. You are waiting for sales, discounts, special conditions or promotions. But the attitude to the stock market is completely different. I've read a lot of posts in Zen and on other sites with stories of people who were at the end of the past or at the beginning they invested in the market, and as the market declined, so did the optimism in comments and articles. </span><span><b>If you have already decided to invest in the market, then wait for discounts and sales of 10-30%, and when all investors are afraid, when everyone is mindlessly selling, that's when you need to buy shares and enter the market </b></span><span>. However, last week this is exactly what I wrote about, and I got a lot of comments from people who thought otherwise. </span><span><b>We are waiting for the growth of our stock market.</b></span><span> The key supports for today are located on futures for </span><span><b>RTS 132200 </b></span><span>on </span><span><b>MICEX 282200 </b></span><span>, and resistances for </span><span><b>RTS 137600 </b></span><span>and </span><span><b>MICEX 289500.</b></span></p><p><span><b>OIL </b></span><span>– OPEC+starts working Today. Yesterday's data showed a new historical record for oil production in the United States, at the level of 13.1 million barrels per day. The mood in oil remains positive, on large TF, such as daily or weekly, oil prices are in the oversold zone. So gradual the increase in oil prices is still more logical. Before and during the OPEC+ meeting, there were and still will be a lot of information stuffing, such as yesterday's message about the early departure of the Russian delegation from the negotiations. This should be treated calmly, since until there is a final decision to reduce oil production by the cartel, and there seems to be nothing to discuss. Let's not forget that production in Libya and Venezuela has almost stopped, and Iran has fallen significantly, and these countries are members of OPEC. That is, their current oil production can be taken into account when determining production quotas. In General, the devil, as always, will be in the details, but usually after the OPEC+ meeting, prices begin to rise movement. Yes, and it seems that the whole of China begins full-fledged work on March 10, so the demand for oil and petroleum products will gradually recover. While we can see growth targets for oil for the next couple of weeks in the area of </span><span><b>55-56 BRENT </b></span><span>and </span><span><b>51-52 LIGHT </b></span><span>. Yesterday evening, he himself entered long, just as he wrote in the past for example, at the level of 51.50 BRENT and 47 light. Trading range of oil prices in </span><span><b>BR-4.20 </b></span><span>for today (50,60 </span><span><b>-51,2) – (52,65 – </b></span><span>53,85), for </span><span><b>CFD </b></span><span></span><span><b>WTI </b></span><span></span><span><b>( </b></span><span>45.75 </span><span><b>– 46,50) – (48,25 - </b></span><span>49.25</span><span><b>) </b></span></p><p><span><b>Precious metals-</b></span><span>TSR for precious metals included in the the consolidation stage. The changes are minimal for the second day. It seems that the next push in prices will be closer to mid-March and the next meeting of the fed and other Central banks. Low bond yields and a weakening dollar will support metals. While we continue to wait for the price increase. Palladium has done its job a "normal" correction of almost $ 500 in a few days, slightly descending from heaven to earth. Now we are waiting for where it will move next. If it goes up, we know what to do with it when it sets its historical maximum at prices that are unambiguously sell. It will go down, perhaps the level of 2100-2250 will be a good level for long.
